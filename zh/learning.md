# 第二部分 学习
# Part II: Learning

第二部分主要分为自主学习和学习资源来帮你学着成为一名前端开发者。
Part two identifies self-directed (i.e. at your own pace when you want) and directed (i.e. formal class room specific times and dates) resources for learning to become a front-end developer.

Note that just because a learning resource is listed, or a category of learning is documented, I am not suggesting that a front-end developer learn everything. That would be absurd. Choose your own slice of expertise within the profession. I'm providing the possibilities of what could be mastered in the field.
